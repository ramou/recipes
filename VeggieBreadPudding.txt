Ingredients


* 1 tbsp of flax seed meal + 3tbsp water
* 2 cups grated apple
* 1 juice of lemon (about 3 tbsp)
* 4 cups of day old bread, cubed small (different breads will lend different flavours and textures to this pudding, so feel free to experiment!)
* 1/2 cup of maple syrup
* 1 1/2 cups of soy milk
* 1/2 tsp of vanilla (tip: you can skip the vanilla if you use vanilla soy milk. It is all I had in the fridge and it worked out just fine)
* 1/2 tsp of cinnamon + cinnamon to garnish

Method



   1. Blend the flax meal and water in a blender, or wisk well in a bowl. Let it sit for a few minutes while you work on grating the apples. It should take on a thick consistency

   2. Grate the apples and mix well with the lemon juice to avoid browning

   3. Mix flax goo, maple syrup, soy milk, vanilla and cinnamon together until smooth.

   4. Grease one 8" x 8" baking pan and put 1/3 of the bread in the bottom, top with 1 cup of grated apples and 1 cup of batter, repeat with a second layer and then top with remaining 1/3 of the bread. Sprinkle some cinnamon on top to taste.

   5. Let the pudding sit in the pan for 15 minutes or so. Preheat the oven to 350F (325F for glass pans), cover the pudding with tinfoil and bake for 40 minutes.

   6. Let it sit for 15 minutes or so to cool down and then enjoy.
