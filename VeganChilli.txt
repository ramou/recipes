2 ½ cups boiling water
2 large onions, minced
1 tbs veggie oil
1 large pepper minced
1 cup corn.

2 tablespoons chilli powder
4 cloves garlic, minced

Salt.

Method:

2. In a large bowl, mix shrooms with boiling water, then stir and leave to stand for 10 minutes.

3. Meanwhile in a large skillet, stir fly the onions (and pepper) by stirring them over high heat adding a tablespoon of water from time to time to keep them from sticking. As onions brown, add enough water to dissolve the brown residue on the bottom of the pan, mixing it into the onions until onions are browned and soft..

4. In a large pot, combine the onions, beans, shrooms and remaining ingredients except salt. Bring to a boil, reduce heat, cover and simmer for a while.
