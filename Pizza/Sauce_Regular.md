# Tomato Sauce for Pizza

## Ingrdients

- 2 tbsp olive oil (28g)
- 3 tsp oregano (3g)
- 1 tbsp basil (2g)
- 1/2 tsp red pepper flakes (1g)
- 1 can of crushed tomatoes (400g)
- 1/2 tsp Worcestershire sauce (2.5g)
- 1 tbsp sugar (12.5g)
- 1/4 tsp cinnamon (0.5g)

## Instructions:

1. Heat the olive oil on medium until fragrant.
2. Add oregano, basil, and red pepper flakes, stirring constantly until the spices become aromatic and their color changes slightly.
3. Add the crushed tomatoes and Worcestershire sauce, then stir regularly for about five minutes.
4. Add sugar and cinnamon, and stir for another five minutes.
5. Lower the heat to a simmer and let it simmer, uncovered, for 20-30 minutes.
6. Remove from heat and let cool.

*Tip: Letting it sit in the fridge for a few days before using will improve the flavor.*

This makes enough sauce for two or three 12/12.5 inch pizzas.
