### Pesto Sauce Recipe

## Ingredients
* 60g (~2 cups)  fresh basil leaves (approximately 100 leaves)
* 25g (~1/2 cup) grated Parmesan cheese
* 35g (~1/4 cup) pine nuts
* 3 garlic cloves
* 55g (~1/4 cup) olive oil (or substitute with avocado oil)
* Salt and pepper to taste

## Instructions
1. **Prepare the Basil and Garlic:** In a food processor, combine the basil leaves, Parmesan cheese, pine nuts, and garlic cloves. Pulse until the ingredients are finely chopped and well combined.
2. **Add the Oil:** With the food processor running, slowly pour in the olive oil (or avocado oil) until the mixture becomes smooth and creamy.
3. **Season:** Season the pesto with salt and pepper to taste.
4. **Use:** Spread the pesto sauce onto your pizza dough, leaving a small border around the edges.
5. **Add Toppings:** Add your desired toppings, such as mozzarella cheese.
6. **Bake:** Bake the pizza in a preheated oven at 500Â°F for 10-12 minutes or until the crust is golden brown and the cheese is melted and bubbly.
7. **Serve:** Remove the pizza from the oven and let it cool for a few minutes before slicing and serving.

## Tips
- **Pan-Roasting Pine Nuts:** Lightly pan-roasting or pan-frying the pine nuts can enhance their flavor, adding a toasty, nutty taste to your pesto. To do this, heat a dry skillet over medium heat, add the pine nuts, and stir frequently for about 2-3 minutes until they are golden brown. Be careful not to burn them.
- **Oil Substitution:** Using avocado oil instead of olive oil can slightly alter the flavor profile of your pesto. Avocado oil has a milder taste and higher smoke point, making it suitable for those who prefer a subtler flavor.

## Suggested Pizza Toppings (for 2 pizzas)
- 4 large vine ripe tomatoes, sliced finely
- 1 large sweet onion, sliced finely
- 700 grams pizza mozzarella
