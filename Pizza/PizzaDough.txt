Ingredients:

4 cups all-purpose flour
10g (or 1 tablespoon) instant yeast
2 tablespoon sugar
1 tablespoon salt
1/4 cup olive oil
1 1/2 cups warm water (110-115°F)
1 tsp savory

Instructions:

 1. In a large mixing bowl, combine the flour, instant yeast, sugar, and salt. Mix well to distribute the ingredients evenly.
 2. Add the olive oil and warm water to the dry ingredients. Mix with a wooden spoon or a stand mixer with the dough hook attachment until the dough comes together into a smooth, elastic ball.
 3. Turn the dough out onto a floured surface and knead it for 3-4 minutes until it becomes smooth and elastic. Cover the dough with a damp cloth and let it rest for 60 minutes.
 4. Preheat your oven to 500°F and place your pizza stone in the oven while it heats up.
 5. Divide the dough into two or three equal parts, depending on how large you want your pizzas to be.
 6. Roll out the dough balls into thin rounds and place them onto a lightly floured pizza peel or a sheet of parchment paper.
 7. Add your desired toppings to the pizzas.
 8. Slide the pizzas onto the preheated pizza stone and bake for 10-12 minutes or until the crust is golden brown and the cheese is melted and bubbly.
 9. Remove the pizzas from the oven with a pizza peel or a large spatula and let them cool for a few minutes before slicing and serving.


Consider reducing yeast slightly. 
Consider letting it rise while rolled, but before sauce is applied.
