Pizza Dough Recipe

Ingredients:
4 cups all-purpose flour
15g (or 1.5 tablespoons) instant yeast
2 tablespoons sugar
1 tablespoon salt
1/4 cup olive oil
1/2 cup warm water (110-115°F)
1 cup warm Greek yogurt (top up with warm milk if short)
1 tsp savory (or sage)

Instructions:
01. Combine instant yeast and sugar with warm water. Let it sit until it begins to bloom.
02. In a large bowl, mix flour, savory (or sage), and salt.
03. Once yeast mixture has bloomed, stir in warm yogurt (and milk, if used) and olive oil. Let sit for a couple of minutes.
04. Combine wet and dry ingredients. Mix until a smooth, elastic dough forms.
05. Knead dough on a floured surface for 3-4 minutes. Cover with a damp cloth and let it rest for 60-90 minutes.
06. Post-rise, knead dough again, divide into two, and let rest covered for 30 minutes.
07. Roll out each dough ball. Add toppings. Let dough rise for 10 minutes.
08. Preheat oven to 500°F. Adjust for convection ovens.
09. Bake pizzas on parchment paper for 10-12 minutes or until golden brown.
10. Remove from oven, cool briefly, slice, and serve.
