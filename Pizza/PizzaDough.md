### Pizza Dough Recipe

#### Ingredients:
- 4 cups all-purpose flour (480g)
- 1 tbsp instant yeast (9g)
- 2 tbsp sugar (25g)
- 1 tbsp salt (18g)
- 2 tbsp avocado oil (28g)
- 1 cup Greek yogurt (240g)
- 1 cup milk (240g) (higher fat preferred, but 2% works)
- 1 tbsp garlic powder (optional) (8g)
- 1 tsp savory or sage (1g)

#### Instructions:
01. In a large bowl, mix flour, salt, savory (or sage), and garlic powder (if using).
02. In a separate bowl, combine the Greek yogurt, milk, and avocado oil.
03. Add the yogurt mixture to the dry ingredients and mix until a sticky, stretchy dough forms.
04. Knead the dough on a floured surface for 3-4 minutes.
05. Cover the dough with a damp cloth and let it rest for 60-90 minutes.
06. After the first rise, knead the dough again, divide it into two portions, and let it rest, covered, for another 30 minutes.
07. Roll out each dough ball. Add your desired toppings. Let the dough rise for 10 minutes.
08. Preheat your oven to 500Â°F (adjust if using a convection oven).
09. Bake the pizzas on parchment paper for 10-12 minutes, or until golden brown.
10. Remove from the oven, let cool briefly, slice, and serve.

*Note: This dough will be stickier and stretchier than typical pizza dough, so flour as needed when rolling it out.*

#### Cold-Rise Adjustments
 * after initial knead, let sit in fridge coverd for several hours and skip intermediate knead.
 * take out and let get to room temperature before kneeding it a bit, splitting it and shaping, as it'll handle better once at room temperature
 * Let it sit after shaping before adding toppings
