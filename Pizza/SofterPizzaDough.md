# Softer Pizza Dough

##Ingredients:
 * 5 cups all-purpose flour
 * 12g (or 1 tablespoon) instant yeast
 * 2.5 tablespoons sugar
 * 1 tablespoon salt
 * 1/4 cup olive oil
 * 1/2 cup milk, slightly cooler than warm
 * 1 cup yogurt, room temperature
 * 1 tsp savory

## Instructions:
**Mix Dry Ingredients:** In a large mixing bowl, combine the flour, instant yeast, sugar, and salt. Mix well to distribute evenly.

**Add Fats:** Stir in the olive oil until the mixture is crumbly.

**Combine Milk and Yogurt:** Adjust the temperature of the milk and yogurt to be slightly cooler than warm. The goal is to slow down the yeast activity for a longer, more controlled rise.

**Mix Wet into Dry:** Gradually add the milk and yogurt mixture to the dry ingredients, stirring until a dough forms.

**First Rise (Bulk Fermentation):** Instead of a quick 60-minute rest, allow the dough to rise in a covered bowl for 1.5 to 2 hours at room temperature until it doubles in size. This longer rise should help develop the dough's structure and flavor.

**Shape and Second Rise:** Divide the dough as usual, shape it into rounds, and then let the shaped dough rise again for about 30-45 minutes before topping. This second rise gives the dough a chance to develop air pockets.

**Preheat Oven and Pizza Stone:** As before, preheat your oven to 500Â°F with the pizza stone inside.

**Bake:** After adding your toppings, bake the pizza for 10-12 minutes or until golden brown. The initial high heat will help create oven spring, which can make the crust airier.

## Additional Tips:
**Cold Fermentation:** For even more flavor and air, consider a cold fermentation process. After the first rise, punch down the dough, divide it, and then refrigerate the portions overnight (or up to 48 hours) in airtight containers. Take them out about an hour before you plan to shape, top, and bake.
**Hydration:** Playing with the hydration level of your dough can also affect its airiness. If the dough is too dry, consider adding a bit more liquid to achieve a slightly stickier consistency, which can support larger air bubbles.
