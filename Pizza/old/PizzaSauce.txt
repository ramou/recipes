-Can of tomatoes crushed (796ml can, if really watery, add a tsp of corn starch)
-4 cloves garlic crushed (I like a mortar and pestle, but since I don't have one I use a heavy rolling pin)
-3 tsp oregano
-1 tbsp basil
-1/8 tsp pepper
-1/4 tsp worstechershire sauce (can be replaced, sort of, by white wine vinegar and maybe some soy sauce and another tbsp sugar if wanting vegetarian)
-1 tbsp sugar
-pinch salt
-2 tbsp olive oil

Heat the oil on mediunm. Put in oregano, basil, peper together and stir around to keep it from burning. Add the crushed tomatoes and stir in the spices. 
Add the sugar, salt, worstechershire sauce and stir in, let it go for 5 minutes. Switch to low heat/simmer and add garlic. Leave simmering, uncovered, 
for 20-30 minutes. Take off heat and let cool. Let sit in the fridge for a few days before using for best flavor.

This makes enough for two or three 12/12.5 inch pizzas.
