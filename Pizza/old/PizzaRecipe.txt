I usually start the pizza dough in the machine, then do the sauce which is better if it sits (better if it sits a day or two). The rest can wait till the 
pizza is out of the machine and you're waiting for it to sit (you do that twice in my dough recipe). Once everything is almost done, grate 
the cheese and slice the pepper/chop the onion. You can leave the tomatoe till after, or chop it with the rest of the vegetables.

Once the pizze is done it's final rising, spread a generous amount of the sauce on the pizze. Then place the sliced pepper evenly over it. 
Then spread the white onions evenly as possible (they should appear to be on pretty thick, but that's ok). Lastly place the cheese on as 
evenly as possible. It should look mountainous in amount, but that's also ok. Put it in an oven that is pre-heated to 425F. Cook for 20 
minutes at that heat, then pull it out, and add the chopped tomatoe to the top of the pizza and place it back in the oven for another 5 
minutes. Pull it out and let it cool a few minutes before slicing and serving.
