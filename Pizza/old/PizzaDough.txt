Bread Maker Pizza Dough

Ingredients for one 12-14 inch crust:
3/4 cup water (80-90ºF)
2 tablespoons oil
2 cups bread flour
1/2 teaspoon sugar
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 1/2 teaspoons bread machine yeast
1/4 cup olive oil.


Directions:
Add water and vegetable oil to pan. Add flour, sugar, and salt. Tap pan to settle dry ingredients, then level ingredients, pushing some of the mixture into corners, to cover water. Make a well in center of dry ingredients; add yeast.

Lock pan into bread maker. Program for dough and start bread maker. When done, remove pan from bread maker. Place dough onto floured surface. 
Knead 1 minute, then let rest 15 minutes.

Roll dough out to fit 12-14 inch pizza pan . Pour olive oil into pan and use gravity to spread it (about a half a mm in the pan). 
Place dough onto oiled pan. Press dough into pan, forming an edge. Let rise in warm draft free place for 20-25 minutes.

Bake in preheated 424ºF oven for 20-25 minutes or until nicely browned on top. Let rest 5 minutes and enjoy!
