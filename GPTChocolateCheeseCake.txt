Oreo Crust:
24 Oreo cookies, including filling (about 264 g)
1/4 cup unsalted butter, melted (4 tablespoons / 56 g) or margarine (4 tablespoons / 56 g)
//Butter is better. With margarine, may want to try 3tbsp and get a crumblier crust that is at least less hard.

1. Crush the Oreo cookies (with the filling) into fine crumbs using a food processor, or place them in a resealable plastic bag and crush them with a rolling pin.
2. In a medium bowl, mix Oreo cookie crumbs with melted butter or margarine. Gently press onto the bottom of the springform pan.
3. pre-bake for 8-10 minutes at 350 degrees F before adding cheesecake.
//Avoid double-stuff ores. The increased sugar content may outweigh the tendency for more filling to make it softer if the sugar caramelizes. Butter will help, and maybe pre-baking a little shorter with the double stuffed. Definitely be gentle when pressing down.

Cheesecake Filling:

500 g cream cheese
1/4 cups white sugar (75 g)
1/2 cup milk (120 mL)
3 eggs
1 1/2 cup sour cream (1/2 cup for cooking in, 1 cup for the top) (360 g total)
1 tablespoon vanilla extract (15 mL)
1/2 cup all-purpose flour (60 g)
6 oz bakers chocolate, melted, or 1/3 cup unsweetened cocoa powder (113 g or 33 g)
1/4 cup heavy cream (60 mL)
1/2 cup chocolate chips (85 g)
DIRECTIONS

1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease an angelfoodcake pan (the one with the hole in the middle).
Mix eggs, milk, and vanilla in a separate bowl.
2. In a large bowl, mix cream cheese with sugar until smooth. Blend in egg/milk mixture until just incorporated.
3. Mix in 1/2 cup sour cream (120 g).
4. Mix in 1/2 cup flour (60 g) until smooth. Divide the filling into two equal parts.
5. Melt the bakers chocolate and mix it into the filling. If using cocoa powder, add it gradually while stiffing.
6. Pour the plain filling over the prepared crust
7. Bake in preheated oven for 1 hour.
8. Turn the oven off, top with the remaining 1 cup of sour cream (240 g), and let the cake cool in the oven with the door closed for 5 to 6 hours; this prevents cracking.
9. To make the chocolate ganache, heat the heavy cream in a small saucepan until it just begins to simmer. Remove from heat and pour over the chocolate chips. Let sit for a minute, then stir until smooth.
10. Once the cheesecake has cooled, spread the chocolate ganache on top, allowing it to set slightly before chilling the cheesecake in the refrigerator.
11. Chill in the refrigerator until serving.

This recipe yields a marbled chocolate cheesecake with a rich chocolate ganache topping and an Oreo (or Graham Cracker) crust. Enjoy!
