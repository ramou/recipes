( 0) My wife says to open the window while cooking because she can't stand the smell of peanut butter, but I've removed the step where it gets cooked.)

1) Start water boiling
2) bring the oil group to a boil in a frying pan on high.
3) mix in the onion group until the onions change color
4) turn off heat completely and mix in peanut butter. It should melt and darken, but take it completely off the heat so as not to burn/cook the pb.
5) Steam the vegetables very lightly, they should still be quite crunchy
6) your water should be boiling now, so toss in the vermicelli for 3 minutes or less, until lightly cooked.
7) pour strained vermicelli into a serving plate.
8) mix veggies and peanut butter sauce
9) pour veggies/sauce over the vermicelli

Should take apprx. 20 minutes, serves 2-4.
