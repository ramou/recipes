2 eggs, separated
1 1/2 cups milk
2 cups plain flour
1/2 teaspoon baking powder
1/4 cup sugar
2 ounces butter, melted
2 tablespoons cold water

Beat egg whites until you get firm peaks. Beat egg yolks and milk lightly together. Add sifted dry ingredients and beat until smooth. Add melted, cooled butter and the water. Blend well. Fold in the firmly beaten egg whites.

Heat the waffle iron. Brush both top and bottom surfaces of waffle iron with a bit of oil. Spoon approximately 2 tablespoons of the waffle mixture into the center of the iron. Close the iron, cook until golden brown, about 1 minute (exact timing depends on your waffle maker. Follow their directions for perfect results).

When the waffle is ready, all of the steam will have stopped emerging from the iron. If you try to lift the top of the iron and the top shows resistance, it is not quite done. Cook 1 minute longer and try again.
