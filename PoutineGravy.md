# Classic Chicken Gravy

## Ingredients:
 * 4 tablespoons butter (salted) (about 60g)
 * 1/4 cup all-purpose flour (about 30g)
 * 2 cups chicken broth (about 500g)
 * 1 teaspoon garlic powder
 * 1 teaspoon onion powder
 * 1/2 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce
 * 1/8 tsp ground pepper
 * 1/2 tsp salt
 * Optional: Herb spicing

## Instructions:
**Make the Roux:** Heate a saute pan. Melt the butter, then whisk in the flour. Cook for about 2 minutes, stirring constantly, until the mixture turns light brown. This cooks off the raw flour taste and forms the base of your gravy.

**Add Liquids Slowly:** Gradually add the chicken broth to the roux, whisking continuously to prevent lumps. The mixture will start to thicken as it heats.

**Season the Gravy:** Add the garlic powder, onion powder, and Worcestershire sauce. Stir well to combine. Allow the mixture to simmer for a few minutes, which will help it thicken and the flavors to meld.

**Adjust Consistency and Seasoning:** If the gravy is too thick, you can thin it with a little more broth. If it's too thin, let it simmer longer. Season with salt and pepper to taste, and add any fresh herbs if you're using them.

**Serve:** Once the gravy reaches your desired consistency and taste, it's ready to be poured over your air-fried fries and cheese curds to complete your poutine.

## Spicing Options
**Smokey:** 1 tsp smoked paprika

**Peppery:** 1 tbsp klack pepercorn. skip original pepper amount. Saute peppercorns in butter and strain out before proceeding.

**Savory:** 1 tsp dried thyme, 1 tsp dried rosemary. Crush them before adding to release flavor
This one tasted a bit like a roast. Flavourful, but wasn't what folks expected.

## Additional Tips:
* **Balancing Flavors:** Feel free to adjust the seasonings according to your family's preference for a truly personalized touch.
* **Consistency:** Aim for a gravy that is neither too thick nor too thin, to perfectly coat the fries and cheese curds.
