One-Pot Sweet and Spicy Sausage and Kidney Bean Rice

# Ingredients:

* 1 cup rice (Basmati or Jasmine works well for this)
* 1.25 cups water or chicken broth (for cooking the rice)
* 2 onions, finely chopped
* 1 cup chopped sausage
* 1 can of kidney beans, drained and rinsed
* 2 tablespoons soy sauce
* 2 worchestershire
* 1 tablespoon honey or brown sugar
* 1 teaspoon chili flakes or sriracha sauce (adjust to taste)
* 2 cloves garlic, minced
* 1 tablespoon vegetable oil

Optional: Bell peppers or snap peas for extra veggies

# Sauté: 
Set the Foodi to sauté mode. Add the vegetable oil, onions, and sliced sausage. Sauté until the onions are translucent and the sausage starts to brown.

#Mix Ingredients:
Add garlic and sauté for another minute. Then, add the rice, kidney beans, soy sauce, honey (or brown sugar), chili flakes (or sriracha), and water or chicken broth. Stir to combine everything evenly.

# Pressure Cook:
Seal the Foodi and set it to pressure cook on high for about 5 minutes. This is typically enough time for white rice. Make sure to follow your Foodi’s instructions for pressure cooking rice.

# Natural Release:
Once cooking is complete, let the pressure release naturally for about 10 minutes, then manually release any remaining pressure.

#Serve:
Fluff the rice with a fork, mixing all the ingredients well. If you opted for additional veggies like bell peppers or snap peas, you could stir them in just before serving or sauté them separately and serve on top for added crunch.
