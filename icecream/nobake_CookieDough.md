## No-Bake Cookie Dough (for Ice Cream)

### Ingredients
- 1/3 cup melted butter
- 1/3 cup brown sugar
- 2 tablespoons sugar
- A pinch of salt
- 1 tablespoon milk
- 1 tablespoon vanilla
- Heat-treated flour until desired consistency (usually about 3/4 to 1 cup)
- 1/2 cup chocolate chips

### Instructions
1. **Combine wet ingredients:** In a mixing bowl, combine the melted butter, brown sugar, sugar, milk, and vanilla. Mix well until the sugar is mostly dissolved and the mixture is smooth.
   
2. **Add dry ingredients:** Gradually add the heat-treated flour and a pinch of salt to the wet mixture. Stir continuously until the dough reaches your desired consistency. Start with 3/4 cup and add more if needed.

3. **Add chocolate chips:** Wait until it has cooled and add in the chocolate chips. Roll in parchment paper and freeze, cutting of rounds (finger diameter) to make the chunks to mix into your vanilla icecream.

### How to Heat-Treat Flour

#### Oven Method
1. Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C).
2. Spread the flour evenly on a baking sheet.
3. Bake for 5-10 minutes, stirring halfway through, until the flour reaches an internal temperature of 165°F (74°C).
4. Let the flour cool completely before using it in your recipe.

#### Microwave Method
1. Place the flour in a microwave-safe bowl.
2. Heat on high in 30-second intervals, stirring between each interval, until the flour reaches 165°F (74°C). This usually takes about 1-2 minutes.
3. Let the flour cool completely before using.
