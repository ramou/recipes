# Honey-Smoked Paprika Drumsticks

## Ingredients:
- Drumsticks (with skin-on)
- 1/4 cup honey
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 1 tablespoon soy sauce
- 2 teaspoons smoked paprika
- 1 teaspoon garlic powder
- 1/2 teaspoon mustard or 1 teaspoon Dijon mustard (based on your preference)
- Salt and pepper to taste
- Optional: A pinch of cayenne pepper for heat

## Instructions:

1. **Prepare the Marinade:**
   - In a bowl, whisk together the honey, olive oil, soy sauce, smoked paprika, garlic powder, mustard (or Dijon mustard), salt, pepper, and cayenne pepper (if using) until well combined.

2. **Marinate the Drumsticks:**
   - Place the drumsticks in a large zip-lock bag or a bowl. Pour the marinade over the drumsticks, ensuring they are well-coated.
   - Seal the bag or cover the bowl and refrigerate for at least 1 hour, or overnight for more flavor.

3. **Preheat the Air Fryer:**
   - Preheat your air fryer to 180째C (350째F) for about 3-5 minutes.

4. **Air Fry the Drumsticks:**
   - Arrange the drumsticks in the air fryer basket in a single layer, making sure they are not touching. You may need to cook them in batches depending on the size of your air fryer.
   - Cook for about 20-25 minutes, or until the drumsticks are cooked through and the skin is crispy. Flip them halfway through the cooking time.

5. **Serving:**
   - Let the drumsticks rest for a few minutes before serving. This allows the juices to redistribute.

6. **Optional Glaze:**
   - If you have extra marinade, you can simmer it in a small saucepan over medium heat until it thickens into a glaze. Brush this glaze over the cooked drumsticks for extra flavor. Ensure any marinade used as a glaze is cooked thoroughly to be safe for consumption.

## Tips:
- **Skin-On for Crispiness:** Keeping the skin on will yield a tastier and more satisfying result due to the crispy texture.
- **Checking Doneness:** Ensure the drumsticks are fully cooked by checking that the internal temperature reaches 75째C (165째F) with a meat thermometer.
- **Resting Time:** Allowing the drumsticks to rest after cooking ensures they retain their juices, making them more flavorful and moist.
