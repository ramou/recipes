# Honey-Smoked Paprika Drumsticks
The flavours didn't quite mix. It definitely needs more marinade time than just an hour or so. To reduce overall time, it may be worth pressure cooking it all together, then air-fry just for crispness. Might be able to pressure cook from frozen with sauce for the same effect, which'd be convenient. Not sure the dijon was a good pick, there's an interest in a more savoury sauce, but the "stickiness" was good. It wasn't crispy enough on the outside, with the skin blackening (though also some caramelization on it), so we may want to consider a coating that crisps better, applied after the pressure cook maybe?


## Ingredients:
- Drumsticks (with skin-on)
- 1/4 cup honey
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 1 tablespoon soy sauce
- 2 teaspoons smoked paprika
- 1 teaspoon garlic powder
- 1/2 teaspoon mustard or 1 teaspoon Dijon mustard (based on your preference)
- Salt and pepper to taste
- Optional: A pinch of cayenne pepper for heat

## Instructions:

1. **Prepare the Marinade:**
   - In a bowl, whisk together the honey, olive oil, soy sauce, smoked paprika, garlic powder, mustard (or Dijon mustard), salt, pepper, and cayenne pepper (if using) until well combined.

2. **Marinate the Drumsticks:**
   - Place the drumsticks in a large zip-lock bag or a bowl. Pour the marinade over the drumsticks, ensuring they are well-coated.
   - Seal the bag or cover the bowl and refrigerate for at least 1 hour, or overnight for more flavor.

3. **Preheat the Air Fryer:**
   - Preheat your air fryer to 180째C (350째F) for about 3-5 minutes.

4. **Air Fry the Drumsticks:**
   - Arrange the drumsticks in the air fryer basket in a single layer, making sure they are not touching. You may need to cook them in batches depending on the size of your air fryer.
   - Cook for about 20-25 minutes, or until the drumsticks are cooked through and the skin is crispy. Flip them halfway through the cooking time.

5. **Serving:**
   - Let the drumsticks rest for a few minutes before serving. This allows the juices to redistribute.

6. **Optional Glaze:**
   - If you have extra marinade, you can simmer it in a small saucepan over medium heat until it thickens into a glaze. Brush this glaze over the cooked drumsticks for extra flavor. Ensure any marinade used as a glaze is cooked thoroughly to be safe for consumption.

## Tips:
- **Skin-On for Crispiness:** Keeping the skin on will yield a tastier and more satisfying result due to the crispy texture.
- **Checking Doneness:** Ensure the drumsticks are fully cooked by checking that the internal temperature reaches 75째C (165째F) with a meat thermometer.
- **Resting Time:** Allowing the drumsticks to rest after cooking ensures they retain their juices, making them more flavorful and moist.
