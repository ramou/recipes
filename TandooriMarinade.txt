1/2 cup plain yogurt.
1 tablespoon of white vinegar.
1 teaspoon salt.
1 teaspoon cumin powder.
1 teaspoon coriander powder.
2 teaspoons paprika.
1/2 teaspoon cayenne powder (red chilli powder if you are using Indian spices).
2 teaspons Garam Masala [optional, if you have it]


Mix dry ingredients. Mix in vinegar to make a paste. Mix into yogurt. Marinade between 2-24 hours.

Should be enough for "four adults" worth of food, whatever that means. Requires experimentation.
