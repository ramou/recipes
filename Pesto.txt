Ingredients:

2 cups fresh basil leaves
1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese
1/4 cup pine nuts
3 garlic cloves
1/4 cup olive oil
Salt and pepper to taste
Instructions:

In a food processor, combine the basil leaves, Parmesan cheese, pine nuts, and garlic cloves. Pulse until the ingredients are finely chopped and well combined.
With the food processor running, slowly pour in the olive oil until the mixture becomes smooth and creamy.
Season the pesto with salt and pepper to taste.
Spread the pesto sauce onto your pizza dough, leaving a small border around the edges.
Add your desired toppings, such as mozzarella cheese, cherry tomatoes, and sliced mushrooms.
Bake the pizza in a preheated oven at 500Â°F for 10-12 minutes or until the crust is golden brown and the cheese is melted and bubbly.
Remove the pizza from the oven and let it cool for a few minutes before slicing and serving.
