Pasta Primavera

Ingredients (use vegan versions):

    * 1.5 cups broccoli florets
    * 4 tbsp veggie oil (olive or sunflower)
    * 1.5 cup onions
    * 2 small zucchini
    * 3/4 cup green beans
    * 1 chopped red pepper
    * 1 chopped green pepper (or a half a pepper if you have one in fridge)
    * 1 cup corn (off the cob)
    * 1/4 cup fresh basil (I bought a bag... coulda used a touch more)
    * 2 small diced fresh tomatoes
    * 1.5 cup chopped Mushrooms (Portobello)
    * 2 teaspoon black pepper
    * salt to taste
    * Spaghetti (Owen suggested a different type of noodle)
    * Veggie stock suggested to sauce it up, although in my mind a primavera should be a less watery sauce.

Directions:

Boil water. Add broccoli florets to the water for about 45 sec to one min (do not let them get soft!!). Drain the broccoli. 

Oil in skillet. Mince the onion and add to the skillet with shrooms over medium-high heat stir often. Chop the zucchini into 1 cm wide circles and add to the skillet. Chop the green beans into 1/2 inch long sections and add to the skillet with diced tomatoes.. Add the red peppers. Add the broccoli to the skillet. Add the corn stir all of this constantly until all the vegi's are firm but cooked. Add basil. Add the pepper and salt to taste. Turn off the heat. Serve over cooked pasta.

I suggest adding favorite vegi's as well to the recipe. (Mushrooms taste good, tomatoes are good too.) The key is to keep the vegi's from getting too soft, then the whole sauce is just mushy.
