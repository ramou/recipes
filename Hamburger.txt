300g medium lean ground beef
2 tbsp flour
1 tbsp Montreal Steak Spice
1 egg

The recipe scales properly.


As in all things, mix the dry ingredients, mix the wet ingredients, then mix those two. Make sure the egg and hamburger are well mixed, which means squishing it up a lot. You're limited in how much squishing around you should do after you mix in the flour.

Make burgers that are roughly 3/4 inch thick for optimal cooking. This recipe keeps moisture in and supports thicker burgers, but I find a quicker cook leads to more evenly seares outside, and thus a better burger. You don't want to fart around with making sure the inside of the thick burger is properly done.
