## Spiced Waffle Recipe

### Ingredients

- 2 1/4 Cups All-Purpose Flour
- 1 Tablespoon Baking Powder
- 3 Tablespoons Sugar
- 1/2 Teaspoon Salt
- 1/2 Teaspoon Cinnamon
- 1/4 Teaspoon Ground Cloves
- 1/4 Teaspoon Nutmeg
- 2 Large Eggs, Separated
- 1/2 Cup Vegetable Oil
- 2 Cups Milk
- 1 Teaspoon Vanilla Extract

### Directions

1. In a bowl, **lightly beat the egg yolks**. Add the milk and vanilla extract, mixing until well combined.
2. **Sift together the dry ingredients** (flour, baking powder, sugar, salt, cinnamon, ground cloves, and nutmeg). Gradually add them to the egg yolk mixture, beating until the batter is smooth.
3. **Stir in the vegetable oil** until the mixture is well blended. Let the batter rest in the fridge for 30 minutes to allow it to ease.
4. **Beat the egg whites** until firm peaks form. Gently fold the beaten egg whites into the batter, being careful not to deflate the mixture.
5. **Preheat your waffle iron**. Once hot, brush both the top and bottom surfaces with a bit of oil to prevent sticking.
6. **Cook the waffles**: Spoon approximately 2 tablespoons of the batter into the center of the iron. Close the iron and cook until golden brown, about 1 minute (the exact time may vary depending on your waffle maker; refer to its directions for best results).
7. **Check for doneness**: When the waffle is ready, all the steam will have stopped emerging from the iron. If the iron resists being opened, allow the waffle to cook for an additional minute before checking again.

Enjoy your delicious spiced waffles!
