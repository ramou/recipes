4 cloves garlic, minced
4 tbsp brown sugar
6 tbsp honey
6 tbsp soy sauce
6 tbsp worcestershire sauce
1/4 tsp ground ginger
1/4 tsp onion power (or garlic powder)
1/4 tsp salt
1/4 tsp cayenne pepper
1/2 tsp ground cinamon
2 tsp vinager
8 dried apricots
1 oz Jack Daniels


Mix the garlic, brown sugar, honey, soy sauce, salt, vinegar, Worcestershire sauce ginger, onion powder, 
cinnamon, and cayenne pepper together in a saucepan. Simmer 5 minutes, stirring.

When cutting up meat, the scraps with a bit of the tasty fat can be thrown in the saucepan while simmering. 
Blend after cooking, then add Jack Daniels and diced apricots to marinade in a sealed container or plastic 
bag. After marinating, re-simmer sauce, collecting drippings from cooked meat as well. Bring to boil, serve 
with meat (and discard after a day or so).
