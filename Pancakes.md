Stuart's Variation:
- Changed out oil for margarine.

## Ingredients
- 190g (1 1/2 cups) all-purpose flour
- 2 tsp baking powder
- 2 tbsp sugar
- 3/4 tsp salt
- 360ml (1 1/2 cups) milk
- 1/2 tsp vanilla extract
- 1 egg
- 2 tbsp margarine, melted

## Instructions

1. **Mix the Dry Ingredients**: In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, sugar, and salt.

2. **Mix the Wet Ingredients**: In a separate bowl, whisk together the milk, margarine, egg, and vanilla extract.

3. **Combine Wet and Dry Ingredients**: Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients. Mix until just combined, leaving some lumps in the batterâ€”do not overmix.

4. **Cook the Pancakes**: 
   - Heat a skillet on medium heat.
   - Lightly grease the skillet with margarine.
   - Scoop the batter onto the skillet using a large spoon to form pancakes.
   - Cook until bubbles start to form on the surface, then flip and cook the other side for about 45 seconds (or almost as long as it initially took bubbles to form), or until golden brown.

5. **Optional Add-ins**:
   - If adding chocolate chips, fold in 1 cup after combining all other ingredients.
   - Use more margarine in the pan and flip more often to prevent burning.

## Notes
- Adjust the cooking time or temperature if necessary.
- Serve warm with your favorite toppings.
