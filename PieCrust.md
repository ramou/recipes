1. 2 ½ cups all-purpose flour
1. 1 tsp salt
1. 1 tsp sugar (optional, for a slightly sweet crust)
1. 1/2 tsp savory for a savory crust
1. 1 cup butter, chilled and cubed
1. 4-8 tbsp ice water


1. Combine Dry Ingredients: In a large bowl, mix together the flour, salt, and sugar (if using).

1. Cut in Fats: Add the chilled, cubed butter and shortening to the flour mixture. Using a pastry cutter or your fingers, cut in the butter and shortening until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs with some pea-sized pieces of butter.

1. Add Ice Water: Sprinkle in ice water, 1 tablespoon at a time, mixing with a fork until the dough just begins to come together. You may not need all the water. The dough should be moist enough to hold together when pinched but not so wet that it’s sticky.

1. Form Dough Discs: Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface, gather it together to consolidate any crumbly bits, and divide it into two equal parts. Form each into a flat disc and wrap in plastic wrap.

1. Chill the Dough: Refrigerate the dough for at least 1 hour or up to 2 days. This allows the gluten to relax and makes the dough easier to roll out.

1. Roll Out Dough for Pie: When ready to use, remove one disc from the refrigerator (keep the other chilled for the top crust). Roll it out on a floured surface to fit your pie dish.

1. Pre-Bake if Needed: Depending on your chicken pot pie recipe, you may need to pre-bake (blind bake) the bottom crust. If not, simply fill it with your chicken pot pie filling, then top with the second rolled-out crust.
