SPICY ORANGE-GINGER CHICKEN
YIELD: 4 servings
INGREDIENTS:

1-1/4 cups orange juice (preferably fresh squeezed) (make sure you zest 1 of the oranges first!)
1/4 cup low-sodium soy sauce
3 tablespoons grated fresh ginger
2 tablespoons minced fresh garlic
2 tablespoons olive oil, divided
2 tablespoons sriracha (or more if you want it really spicy)
1-1/2 tablespoons rice vinegar
2 teaspoons light brown sugar
2 teaspoons orange zest
1/4 teaspoon ground white pepper
1-1/4 lb. boneless, skinless chicken breasts, cut into thin strips
1 tablespoon cornstarch
Brown rice, white rice or quinoa for serving
1/4 cup sliced green onions
DIRECTIONS:

In small bowl, whisk together orange juice, soy sauce, ginger, garlic, 1 tablespoon oil, sriracha, vinegar, brown sugar, orange zest and pepper. Place chicken in a large ziploc bag; pour 1/3 cup marinade over chicken. Seal bag and marinate in refrigerator 1 hour.
Remove chicken from marinade; discard marinade. Heat large skillet or wok over high heat. Add remaining oil. In 2 batches, add chicken and cook each batch 5 to 6 minutes or until chicken is golden brown and has lost its pink color throughout, stirring frequently. Remove chicken from pan.
Reduce heat to medium-high; add remaining marinade to skillet; heat to boiling. In small bowl, whisk together cornstarch and 1 tablespoon water; whisk into marinade, and boil 1 minute. Return chicken to skillet; cook 1 minute or until heated through. Serve over rice or quinoa, sprinkled with green onions.

I'm thinking of taking the chicken out, dusting it with flour before frying to try to get a crispier outside, and once it's all fried up, taking the marinade and reducing it with the cornstarch as suggested and then re-adding it to put it over rice crispy and saucy.
