500 g diced coocked chicken
6 tbsp vegetable oil
60 g (4tbsp) cooking wine
6 green onions, diced
1 cup frozen peas
4 cup shredded carrots
1/4 cup soy sauce

1 dry cup rice (cooked, so whatever 1 cup dry make)
1 garlic omlette, diced


Garlic Omlette:
2 tbsp vegetable oil
4 eggs
4 tsp milk
1 tsp garlic powder
1/4 tsp pepper
pinch of salt

heat 2 vegetable oil to mid high. Whisk omlette ingredients. Pour in and cook quickly, flipping once (try not to brown it). Chop it up in the pan after the first flip so it's in rough slices and remove from heat once cooked. Even go so far as to get it out of the pan so the eggs stay soft and down brown.

Cook Omlette and let sit.

Cook chicken and oil on medium high heat till sizzle (aprx 3 min starting from oil mixed with chicken, which gives more tender results than starting from hot oil).
Add cooking wine and saute for ~3
Add omlette and switched to medium heat and stir it vigorously for ~3 minutes, not letting the omlette brown.
Added rice and soy, stir until well-mixed.
Added peas/carrots/grean onions and mix will, but don't cook, remove from heat as soon as mixed.

If you have more rice/chicken, you can go with more carrots/peas/soy, but unless it's a lot more, omelette will probably be fine. It serves as flavor distribution.
