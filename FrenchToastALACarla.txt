I'm glad Karen liked my french toast.  Visay says "it's all in the bread".  So, most important I guess is to buy the Italian white sliced bread.  I can't remember what's it's called but the packaging has some green, red and white on it.  I don't really have any precise measurements (surprise), but it goes something like this:

3 eggs
1 cup Baileys (milk)
8 slices Italian-style sandwhich bread.

- Beat 3 eggs in bowl with fork
- Add 1 up Bailey's Irish Cream (or milk if you're boring)
- Dip bread, both sides, real quick, and place in pan over stove (yeah...pan has olive oil which is already warmed up...butter tastes better though).
- Fry until golden, then flip.
