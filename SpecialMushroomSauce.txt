
Mushroom topping:
1 basket white mushrooms (220-250g)
1/4 tsp worstecherchire sauce
1 tsp rosemary
1 tsp basil
1/4 tsp black pepper
a pinch of salt
8 pecans, crushed
2 tbsp olive oil

Chop up the mushrooms finely. Heat oil in a non-stick pan (low-medium heat (my oven goes lo 1-9 hi, and I use 3)). Add in the mushrooms once heated. 
Stir carefully until the mushrooms begin to turn color a bit, then add salt. Stir until mushrooms are fairly dark (5 mins), then add spices and worstechershire sauce.
Stir for another 2 minutes and add the sauce. Stir infrequently for another 5 minutes and then take off heat and set aside.
