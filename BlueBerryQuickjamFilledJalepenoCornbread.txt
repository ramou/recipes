Ingredients

QUICK JAM:
2 cups fresh blueberries
1 cup sugar
1 tablespoon cider vinegar
1/4 teaspoon kosher salt
CORNBREAD:
1/2 cup 2% milk
1 tablespoon lemon juice
1-1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1/2 cup yellow cornmeal
1/2 cup sugar
3 teaspoons baking powder
1/2 teaspoon kosher salt
2 tablespoons unsalted butter
1 tablespoon honey
2 large eggs, room temperature
1/3 cup canola oil
2 jalapeno peppers, seeded and minced

Directions

1)In a large heavy saucepan, combine blueberries, sugar, vinegar and kosher salt. Bring to a boil over high heat. Cook, stirring constantly, 5 minutes. Cool completely. Refrigerate, covered, overnight.
2)For cornbread, preheat oven to 350Â°. Combine milk and lemon juice; let stand briefly. In another bowl, whisk next 5 ingredients. In a small bowl, microwave butter and honey on high for 30 seconds; cool slightly. Whisk eggs and oil into milk mixture (mixture may appear curdled). Add butter mixture; whisk until well combined. Add flour mixture; whisk just until combined. Fold in jalapenos.
3)Pour 2 cups batter into a well-buttered 10-in. fluted tube pan. Spoon half to three-fourths of blueberry quick jam over batter. Cover with remaining batter. Bake until a toothpick inserted in center comes out clean, 30-35 minutes. Cool 10 minutes; invert onto a cake plate or serving platter. Drizzle with remaining blueberry quick jam.

Test Kitchen tip
For best results, make the jam a day ahead, giving it plenty of time to cool.
Yes, blueberries and jalapeno peppers! You'll be surprised at how great these two ingredients taste together.
