1c Brown Sugar
4tbsp flour
1tsp cinnamon
12 medium-sized apples

Fills a 10" shell or 2x 9" (ish)


Core/peel/slice apples

Mix flour/sugar/cinnamon thoroughly. Mix in with apples. Put in shell, bake at 300-350F for 60-75mins. Don't forget to poke holes.

I personally prefer the 10". You get a thicker, better pie.
