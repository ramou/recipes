Technically a Ganache...

1/2 cup chocolate chips (trying to find optimal ratio, probably 1/2... a whole cup wasn't good.)
4tbsp milk
1/4 tsp vanilla
1/2 tbsp whiskey

1) Heat chocolate and milk in sauce pan on medium until simmering and all chocolate appears melted. Don't stop stirring! 
2) Add vanilla and whiskey and stir some more. It should smooth out and take on a nice shine.

Takes less than 10 minutes.
