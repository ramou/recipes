Stuart::I altered the recipe so I could make it with two standard cream cheese packages. Also changed the ratio of sour cream and its use, as I like sour cream on top too

INGREDIENTS

    * 15 graham crackers, crushed
    * 2 tablespoons butter, melted

    * 500 g cream cheese
    * 3/4 cups white sugar
    * 1/2 cup milk
    * 3 eggs
    * 1 1/2 cup sour cream (1/2 for cooking in, 1 for the top)
    * 1 tablespoon vanilla extract
    * 1/2 cup all-purpose flour

DIRECTIONS

   1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a angelfoodcake pan (the one with the hole in the middle)
   2. In a medium bowl, mix graham cracker crumbs with melted butter. Press onto bottom of springform pan.
   3. Mix eggs, milk and vanilla
   3. In a large bowl, mix cream cheese with sugar until smooth. Blend in egg/milk mixture until just incorporated
   4. Mix in 1/2 cup sour cream
   5. Mix in 1/2 cup flour until smooth. Pour filling into prepared crust.
   6. Bake in preheated oven for 1 hour. 
   7. Turn the oven off, top with remaining cup of sour cream and let cake cool in oven with the door closed for 5 to 6 hours; this prevents cracking.
   7. add pie filling/FLAVORING on top while it is chilling so flavor will stick in sour cream.
   9. Chill in refrigerator until serving.
