# Honey Sting Roll

## Review
This was one of the favourites

## Ingredients
- Tempura shrimp or chicken strips
- Honey-garlic sauce
- Spicy mayo
- Cucumber, thinly sliced
- Sushi rice
- Nori (seaweed)
- Jalapeño or chili flakes (for the "sting")

## Method

1. **Prepare the Protein:**
   - If using tempura shrimp or chicken strips, cook them until crispy.
   - Toss the cooked protein in a honey-garlic sauce, ensuring they're well-coated.

2. **Assemble the Roll:**
   - Place a sheet of nori on a bamboo sushi mat, shiny side down.
   - Spread a thin layer of sushi rice over the nori, leaving a small border at the top.
   - Lay the honey-garlic coated protein, cucumber, and a few slices of jalapeño or a sprinkle of chili flakes along the center of the rice.
   - Add a drizzle of spicy mayo for an extra kick.

3. **Roll the Sushi:**
   - Roll the sushi into a tight log using the bamboo mat, starting from the edge closest to you.
   - Slice into bite-sized pieces with a sharp knife.

4. **Serve:**
   - Serve with extra honey-garlic sauce on the side, along with soy sauce and pickled ginger.
