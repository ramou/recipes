# Sushi Rice Recipe with White Vinegar

## Ingredients:
- 4 cups sushi rice (dry)
- 4 1/2 cups water
- 1 cup white vinegar
- 4 tablespoons sugar
- 4 teaspoons salt

## Instructions:

1. **Rinse the Rice**:
   - Place the sushi rice in a large bowl.
   - Rinse under cold water, gently agitating with your hands until the water runs clear. This removes excess starch and helps the rice achieve the right texture.

2. **Cook the Rice**:
   - Transfer the rinsed rice to a rice cooker or a pot.
   - Add 4 1/2 cups of water.
   - If using a rice cooker, follow the machine’s instructions to cook. If using a pot, bring to a boil, then cover and reduce to a simmer for 18 minutes. Turn off the heat and let it sit, covered, for an additional 10 minutes.

3. **Prepare Sushi Vinegar Mixture**:
   - In a small pot, combine 1 cup of white vinegar, 4 tablespoons of sugar, and 4 teaspoons of salt.
   - Heat over low heat, stirring until the sugar and salt dissolve completely. Do not boil.

4. **Season the Rice**:
   - Transfer the cooked rice to a large wooden or plastic bowl (avoid metal as it will react with the vinegar).
   - Gently fold in the sushi vinegar mixture with a rice paddle or a wide flat spoon, slicing through the rice at an angle to avoid mashing it.
   - Flatten the rice out on some parchment paper
   - Fan the rice as you mix to help it cool and give it a shiny finish. The rice should be room temperature when you’re ready to use it for making sushi.

This recipe will yield enough seasoned sushi rice for several rolls, depending on the size and number of rolls you plan to make.
