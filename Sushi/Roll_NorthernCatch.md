# Northern Catch Roll

## Ingredients
- Pollock, cooked or raw (sliced thin if raw)

## Method
1. **Prepare the Pollock:**
   - If using raw pollock, ensure it's sushi-grade and slice thinly.
   - If cooking, lightly season and cook the pollock in a pan or oven until done.

2. **Assemble the Roll:**
   - Place a sheet of nori (seaweed) on a bamboo sushi mat, shiny side down.
   - Spread a thin layer of sushi rice over the nori, leaving a small border at the top.
   - Lay the pollock, avocado, and cucumber along the center of the rice.
   - Drizzle spicy mayo over the pollock.

3. **Roll the Sushi:**
   - Roll the sushi into a tight log using the bamboo mat, starting from the edge closest to you.
   - Slice into bite-sized pieces with a sharp knife.

4. **Serve:**
   - Serve with extra spicy mayo, soy sauce, and pickled ginger.
