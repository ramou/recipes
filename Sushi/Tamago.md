# Tamago Recipe (4 Eggs)

## Ingredients
- 4 large eggs
- 2 tablespoons sugar
- 1 tablespoon soy sauce
- 1 tablespoon mirin (optional, adds a touch of sweetness)
- 1 teaspoon dashi stock (optional, for extra umami)

## Instructions

1. **Prepare the Mixture:**
   - In a bowl, beat the eggs thoroughly.
   - Add sugar, soy sauce, and mirin (and dashi stock if using).
   - Mix well until the sugar dissolves and the mixture is smooth.

2. **Cook the Tamago:**
   - Heat a non-stick pan over medium-low heat. Lightly oil the pan.
   - Pour a thin layer of the egg mixture into the pan. Swirl the pan to cover the bottom evenly.
   - When the egg is mostly set but still slightly runny on top, carefully roll the egg into a log from one side to the other.
   - Push the rolled egg to one side of the pan. Add another thin layer of the egg mixture to the pan, letting it run under the rolled egg.
   - When this layer is mostly set, roll the egg log over it. Repeat until all the egg mixture is used.

3. **Shape and Slice:**
   - Once the tamago is fully cooked, transfer it to a bamboo sushi mat or a clean towel.
   - Gently press to shape it into a uniform log (optional).
   - Allow it to cool slightly, then slice into even pieces.

4. **Serve:**
   - Enjoy as is, or use as a topping for sushi!
