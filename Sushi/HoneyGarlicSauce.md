# Honey Garlic Sauce

## Ingredients
- 1/2 cup honey
- 3 cloves garlic, minced
- 1/4 cup soy sauce
- 2 tablespoons vinegar
- 1 tablespoon cornstarch
- 1/4 cup water
- 1 tablespoon sesame oil (optional, for extra flavor)
- 1 teaspoon chili flakes (optional, for some heat)

## Method

1. **Prepare the Sauce Base:**
   - In a small saucepan, combine honey, minced garlic, soy sauce, and rice vinegar (if using).
   - Heat over medium heat until the mixture begins to simmer, stirring occasionally.

2. **Thicken the Sauce:**
   - In a separate small bowl, mix the cornstarch with water to create a slurry.
   - Gradually whisk the cornstarch slurry into the simmering sauce.
   - Continue to cook, stirring constantly, until the sauce thickens to your desired consistency (about 1-2 minutes).

3. **Finish and Serve:**
   - If using, stir in sesame oil and chili flakes for additional flavor.
   - Remove the sauce from heat and let it cool slightly before using.

4. **Storage:**
   - Store any leftover sauce in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to a week.

## Tips
- For a milder garlic flavor, saut√© the garlic in a bit of oil before adding the other ingredients.
- Adjust the sweetness by adding more or less honey to taste.
