1/2 cube veggie bouillon
1 cup water (dissolve boullion in it before starting)

1/4 tsp sage
1/4 tsp thyme
1/8 tsp cumin (maybe lose the dumin... Karen doesn't like the falvor)
1/8 tsp ginger (maybe move to 1/4)
1/8 tsp onion powder

generous sprinkles of salt and pepper

1/2 tbsp flour gently sprinkled in to avoid clumps (use a whisk violently)

1 tbsp honey garlic sauce (soy sauce and garlic with a touch of sugar if you're on the cheap)

(Will now need to figure out how to add enough cornstarch to thicken it)
