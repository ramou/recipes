## Naan Bread Recipe

### Ingredients

- 4 Cups (500g) All-Purpose Flour
- 1.5 Tsp Salt
- 2 Tsp Sugar
- 1 Cup Warm Milk (Almond Milk as a substitute)
- 1 Cup Yogurt (Almond Yogurt as a substitute)
- 1 Tbsp Quick Yeast
- 1/4 Cup Warm Water
- 2 Tbsp Melted Butter (Substitute with Olive Oil, optionally infused with a few cloves of crushed garlic)

### Directions

1. **Prepare the yeast mixture**: Mix sugar and warm water in a small bowl. 
2. **Activate the yeast**: Add yeast to the sugar-water mixture and wait until it becomes active and foams.
3. **Mix dry ingredients**: In a large bowl, combine flour and salt.
4. **Prepare wet ingredients**: Thoroughly mix the milk and yogurt into the activated yeast. If using, add crushed garlic strained from the olive oil to the milk and yogurt mixture first.
5. **Combine wet and dry ingredients**: Add the wet ingredients to the dry ones. Knead until the dough is smooth.
6. **Let the dough rest**: Cover the dough and allow it to rest for 1-2 hours.
7. **Form the naans**: Divide the dough into balls and roll each ball into a flat oval shape.
8. **Preheat**: Preheat your BBQ or oven with a pizza stone to its maximum heat.
9. **Bake the naans**: Place naan on the stone, cooking each side for 2-3 mins until puffed and golden.
10. **Final touch**: Brush each naan with melted butter or olive oil for a vegan option.

*Note*: For an authentic char, use a BBQ. An oven with a pizza stone is a great alternative.
