Use Savory pie crust

1 10" Pie shell (for 9", halve eggs/milk, basil and not-quite halve the onion/ham)

6 eggs
3 cups heavy cream cream (can do it with soy/almond/regular milk)
2 cups guyere/emental (crumbled)
1 cup black forest ham, minced
1 cup caramelized onions (greatly reduced liquid for best results)
1/8 cup sun-dried tomatoes
1 tsp basil
1 tsp salt

01. Blind-bake pie crust
02. Set oven to 300F
03. whisk egg/liquid/salt/basil until smooth
04. layer 1/2 cheese on bottom of crust
05. alternate layers of ham and onion on top of the cheese (ham/onion/ham/onion)
06. pour egg mixture overtop.
07. sprinkle remainder of cheese on top
08. Put in oven for 60 minutes



You can use different cheese/fill combinations, but strongly suggest cheese on top/bottom and goods layered in the middle approach.
