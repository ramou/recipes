Stuart:
-Changed out oil for margarine.


1 1/2 cups flour
2 tsp baking powder
2 tbsp sugar
3/4 tsp salt
1 1/2 cups milk
1/2 tsp Vanilla Extract
1 egg
2 tbsp margarine

Mix the dry ingredients together. Then mix the milk, margarine, eggs and vanilla. Once the wet ingredients are well mixed,  combine them well with the dy ingrediants and try to get some of the lumps out of the batter. Don't worry about making it perfectly smooth. It will be fine.

Heat a skillet on medium heat. When heated, scoop the pancake batter recipe into the frying pan with a large spoon 
to make individual pancakes. The pan will probably only take 1 or two pancakes at a time. Cook on one side until 
the top begins to bubble, then flip over and cook on the other side. I use margarine to grease the pan

I cook on a bit below medium heat, 45 seconds on each side, but you may have to adjust time or temperature.

If you're adding chocolate chips, 1 cup should do the trick. Fold them in once all other ingredients are combined. Use more margarine in the pan and flip more often.
