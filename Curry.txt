Originally from " http://www.robertsplace.ca/recipes/easychickencurry.htm " I have adjusted 
the spicing, swapped chicken for tofu, and eventually did away with both, _(and used ground cherries instead of my original replacement lychees)_used lychees instead of the originally suggested raisins/pineapple.
-At this point, the recipe has deviated greatly from the original.

1 large white onion, chopped (or 2 yellow onions)
1 Green Bell Pepper chopped
2-3 cloves garlic, minced
1/4 cup (60ml) olive oil
8 fl.oz (240ml) vegetable stock
28 oz (796ml) can plum tomatoes, including juice
1 cup (250ml) frozen peas
1 can Chick Peas
2 tbsp (30ml) fresh lemon juice
1 can lychees
2 cups plain yogurt (high fat/greek yogurt, preferably)

3 tablespoons (45ml) curry powder (to taste)
1/4 tsp cumin
1/2 tsp thyme
1/2 tsp ground chilli 
1/4 tsp cayenee pepper


Heat most of the oil in a large sauce pan till it is fragrant. Then lower the heat to medium and throw in all the spices. 
Fry them until the mixture begins to change color (lighter or darker, depending on how thickly it is spread on the pan). 

In a smaller pan, sautee onions and garlic till onions are just beginning to turn translucent. Mix with spice. Fry it up till the onions are well mixed with the spice.

Add stock, chick peas tomatoes and stir well, breaking up the tomatoes (I like 
using pre-diced/crushed tomatoes). Simmer uncovered to thicken, stirring occasionally on low-medium heat 
for about 30 minutes. Add peas and simmer for an additional 15 minutes, then add the lychees and green pepper along with the lemon juice. Simmer an additional 5 minutes and serve, mixed with yogurt to taste.

Dish can be garnished with fresh green coriander leaves and/or tomatoe slices fried in olive oil 
with some fennel seed.

Serve with steamed rice and roti flatbread.
